Our project is about Car crash detection system, this project model can be implemented well with both older & newer cars.
Working:-
The Car will start only if the driver is wearing a belt & the alcohol sensor doesn't detect any traces of alcohol, if both cases are false then the car won't start thereby reducing about 40% of the accidents occured every year.
In case any accident is detected then the impact will trigger the vibration sensor, using node mcu and gps module the exact coordinates of the car, time, and speed information will be sent to blynk server. 
This information can be accessed by blynk app & road safety committee to provide immediate healthcare facilities can be provided in emergency situations.
